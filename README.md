# Maracuja

My very own mini deep learning library. Will build a tiny library from scratch that provides basic functionality to build neural networks. I will start with convolutional networks because this is what I spend most of my time on but will add functionality as time goes on for standard fully connected feed-forward networks and later recurrent networks. Below is a list of what I will build

Imagenet demo in jupyter notebook to follow
